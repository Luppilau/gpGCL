### Short explanation of the framework

### Capabilities

The markdown pages support a multitude of features.

Sometimes what you wrote last week is so good that you just _have_ to include it again.

I'm not gonna stand in the way of your egomania.

Yeah, thats right you can put wigdets in markdown (`.svx` files or otherwise). You can put markdown in widgets too.
<Card minHeight="200px">

#### Example editor

<Editor options={{readOnly: true}} value={editor_value} />
</Card>

<a href="/about">You can even create multiple pages and link between them</a>

Sometimes you need your widgets **inlined** because why shouldn't you.
Obviously you have access to values defined in YAML (namespaced under `metadata`) and anything defined in an fenced `js exec` block can be referenced directly.

Normal markdown stuff works too:

| like  | this |
| ----- | ---- |
| table | here |
| table | here |
| table | here |

And _this_ and **THIS**. And other stuff. You can also use all your favorite Svelte features, like `each` blocks:

<ul>
{#each list as item}
  <li>{item}</li>
{/each}
</ul>

and all the other good Svelte stuff.
